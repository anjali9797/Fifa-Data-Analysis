# Fifa-Data-Analysis
Performing several visualisation and clustering tasks on Fifa data and analysing the clusters formed to gain deeper insights
The code is contained in the Jupyter Notebooks for Tasks folder. Using this we can see what all analysis was done on the data and how I did the analysis.
The data which I used for the analysis is from the football_data.csv file and the Report.pdf contains all the visualisations and results of the experimentation done.
